# Python-almanac

The farmer's almanac is a calendar with, in addition to the date (day and month), a weather forecast for each day (e.g. "partly cloudy" or "rain"), possible important events (such as the start of spring sowing) and a wise saying of the day. Events can also be empty.

Implement an application that allows you to enter data into the almanac one day at a time and to browse the almanac. Data is not necessarily entered in chronological order, but on any day the user wants. When browsing, it is possible to see the events of a given month and their dates at once or all the information of a single day. If no data has been entered for the day in question, a notification will be displayed.
